# Background

<p class="uk-text-lead uk-paragraph">{`A collection of utility classes to add different backgrounds to elements.`}</p>

## Usage

On your `tailwind.config.js` file, add the Background component within the `ui()` plugin.

```javascript
import ui from "franken-ui";

ui({
    components: {
        background: {
            hooks: {},
            media: true
        }
    }
}),
```

To apply a background color to an element, add one of the following classes. The actual color for each modifier is defined by the UIkit style that you have chosen or customized.

| Class                      | Description                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `.uk-background-default`   | Applies the default background color. |
| `.uk-background-muted`     | Applies a muted background color.     |
| `.uk-background-primary`   | Applies the primary background color. |
| `.uk-background-secondary` | Applies a secondary background color. |

```html
<div class="uk-background-primary"></div>
```

<span class="uk-label uk-label-primary">Note</span> To adapt your content for better visibility on each background, add the helper classes like `text-*-foreground`. Use the [Padding component](/docs/padding) to add some padding to the elements.

<Example component="background" index={0} />

## Size modifiers

This component features classes to specify the size of background images by keeping its intrinsic ratio.

| Class                       | Description                                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.uk-background-cover`      | Scales the background image to completely cover the containing area.                           |
| `.uk-background-contain`    | Scales the background image as far as its width and height can fit inside the containing area. |
| `.uk-background-width-1-1`  | Scales the background image to fill 100% of the available width.                               |
| `.uk-background-height-1-1` | Scales the background image to fill 100% of the available height.                              |

<span class="uk-label uk-label-primary">Note</span> When using these classes, the
background position automatically shifts to the middle and background-repeat is set
to no-repeat.

```html
<div class="uk-background-cover"></div>
```

<Example component="background" index={1} />

## Position modifiers

To alter the background position of your image â€” which is in the top left-hand corner of the area by default, add one of the following classes.

| Class                          | Description                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.uk-background-top-left`      | The initial position of the image is in the top left hand corner.     |
| `.uk-background-top-center`    | The initial position of the image is at the top.                      |
| `.uk-background-top-right`     | The initial position of the image is in the top right hand corner.    |
| `.uk-background-center-left`   | The initial position of the image is on the left.                     |
| `.uk-background-center-center` | The initial position of the image is in the middle.                   |
| `.uk-background-center-right`  | The initial position of the image is on the right.                    |
| `.uk-background-bottom-left`   | The initial position of the image is in the bottom left hand corner.  |
| `.uk-background-bottom-center` | The initial position of the image is at the bottom.                   |
| `.uk-background-bottom-right`  | The initial position of the image is in the bottom right hand corner. |

```html
<div class="uk-background-top-left"></div>
```

<Example component="background" index={2} />

## No repeat

To keep smaller images from repeating to fill the background area, add the `.uk-background-norepeat` class.

```html
<div class="uk-background-norepeat"></div>
```

## Attachment

You can also apply a fixed background attachment, so that the image remains in its position while scrolling the site.

```html
<div class="uk-background-fixed"></div>
```

<Example component="background" index={3} />

## Responsive

Add one of the following classes to limit the display of background images to certain viewport sizes. This is great in cases where the image and content overlap on a phone screen in a way that would make text illegible.

| Class                     | Description                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.uk-background-image@s`  | Displays the background image on device widths of _640px_ and larger.  |
| `.uk-background-image@m`  | Displays the background image on device widths of _768px_ and larger.  |
| `.uk-background-image@l`  | Displays the background image on device widths of _1024px_ and larger. |
| `.uk-background-image@xl` | Displays the background image on device widths of _1280px_ and larger. |

```html
<div class="uk-background-image@m"></div>
```

## Blend modes

Add one of the following classes to apply different blend modes to your background image. You can combine these with the background color classes, as well.
