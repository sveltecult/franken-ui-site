# Visibility

<p class="uk-text-lead uk-paragraph">{`Use responsive visibility classes to display or hide elements on different devices.`}</p>

<div class="uk-alert uk-alert-danger mt-6">
  <div class="uk-alert-title">Notice</div>
  <div class="uk-alert-description">
    This documentation is a work in progress.
  </div>
</div>

## Usage

<span class="uk-label uk-label-primary">Note</span> If you are not using Tailwind
CSS, you can skip this step. On your `tailwind.config.js` file, add the Visibility
component within the `ui()` plugin.

```javascript
import ui from "franken-ui";

ui({
    components: {
        visibility: {
            hooks: {},
            media: true
        }
    }
}),
```

Add one of these classes to hide an element.

| Class           | Description                                                                                                                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.uk-hidden`    | Hides the element on any device. This is more of a legacy class. The recommended way to do this, is to use the `hidden` attribute. |
| `.uk-invisible` | Hides the element without removing it from the document flow.                                                                      |

```html
<div hidden></div>

<div class="uk-invisible"></div>
```

## Responsive

This component provides responsive classes to hide or display elements on different viewports.

### Hidden

Add one of the `.uk-hidden-*` classes to hide the element from screens larger than a specified width.

| Class          | Description                                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `uk-hidden@s`  | Only affects device widths of _640px_ and larger.  |
| `uk-hidden@m`  | Only affects device widths of _768px_ and larger.  |
| `uk-hidden@l`  | Only affects device widths of _1024px_ and larger. |
| `uk-hidden@xl` | Only affects device widths of _1280px_ and larger. |

```html
<!-- Hidden on tablets and larger -->
<div class="uk-hidden@m"></div>
```

<span class="uk-label uk-label-primary">Note</span> In this example the green elements
are hidden on screens that are larger than the defined breakpoint. Resize your browser
window to see the effect.

<Example component="visibility" index={0} />

### Visible

Use `.uk-visible-*` classes to show the element for screens larger than the specified width.

| Class           | Description                                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `uk-visible@s`  | Only affects device widths of _640px_ and larger.  |
| `uk-visible@m`  | Only affects device widths of _768px_ and larger.  |
| `uk-visible@l`  | Only affects device widths of _1024px_ and larger. |
| `uk-visible@xl` | Only affects device widths of _1280px_ and larger. |

```html
<!-- Visible on tablets and larger -->
<div class="uk-visible@m"></div>
```

<span class="uk-label uk-label-primary">Note</span> In this example the green elements
are displayed on screens that are larger than the defined breakpoint. Resize your
browser window to see the effect.

<Example component="visibility" index={1} />

## Toggle

To display elements on hover or focus only, add the `.uk-visible-toggle` class to a parent element and one of the following classes to any child elements which should be hidden.

| Class                 | Description                                                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.uk-hidden-hover`    | The element is removed from the document flow when hidden.     |
| `.uk-invisible-hover` | The element is not removed from the document flow when hidden. |

The child elements will be displayed when the parent element is hovered or focused. Add `tabindex="0"` to the parent element to allow it to receive focus through keyboard navigation and on touch devices.

If there are `a` or `button` elements within the hidden child element, they are already focusable through keyboard navigation and will make the child element appear. Therefore, add `tabindex="-1"` so the parent element is still focusable on touch devices.

```html
<div class="uk-visible-toggle" tabindex="0">
  <div class="uk-hidden-hover"></div>
</div>
```

<Example component="visibility" index={2} />

## Touch

Add the `.uk-hidden-touch` class to hide elements on touch devices and the `.uk-hidden-notouch` to hide elements on devices without a touch screen.

```html
<!-- Hidden on touch devices -->
<div class="uk-hidden-touch"></div>

<!-- Hidden on no-touch devices -->
<div class="uk-hidden-notouch"></div>
```

<Example component="visibility" index={3} />
