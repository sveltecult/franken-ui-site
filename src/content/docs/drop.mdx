# Drop

<p class="uk-text-lead uk-paragraph">{`Position any element in relation to another element.`}</p>

The Drop component is aim-aware. This means the drop stays open as long as the mouse pointer moves towards the drop. An additional delay ensures that the drop stays open even if the mouse pointer shortly moves in another direction. A drop closes immediately if another menu item is hovered.

## Usage

<span class="uk-label uk-label-primary">Note</span> If you are not using Tailwind
CSS, you can skip this step. On your `tailwind.config.js` file, add the Drop component
within the `ui()` plugin.

```javascript
import ui from "franken-ui";

ui({
    components: {
        drop: {
            hooks: {}
        }
    }
}),
```

Any content, like a button, can toggle the drop component. Just add the `uk-drop` attribute to a block element following the toggle.

```html
<button type="button"></button>
<div uk-drop></div>
```

To group the toggle and the dropdown, just wrap them with a container element and add the `.uk-inline` class from the [Utility component](utility.md#inline).

```html
<div class="uk-inline">
  <button type="button"></button>
  <div uk-drop></div>
</div>
```

<span class="uk-label uk-label-primary">Note</span> The Drop component has no default
styling. In this example, we've used a card from the [Card component](/docs/card) for
visualization.

<Example component="drop" index={0} />

## Mode

By default, the drop is toggled on hover and on click. Set the `mode` option to change the toggle behavior.

| Mode          | Description                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `click,hover` | Toggle drop on click and hover. |
| `click`       | Toggle drop on click only.      |
| `hover`       | Toggle drop on hover only.      |

```html
<div uk-drop="mode: click"></div>
```

<Example component="drop" index={1} />

## Parent icon

To create a parent icon, just add the `uk-drop-parent-icon` attribute to a `<span>` element.

```html
<button type="button">Parent <span uk-drop-parent-icon></span></button>
<div uk-drop="mode: click"></div>
```

<Example component="drop" index={2} />

## Width and Grid

You can place a grid from the [Grid component](/docs/grid) inside a drop. Just wrap the content with a `<div>` element and add the `uk-grid` attribute. If the grid should stack automatically whenever the drop no longer fits its container, just add the `.uk-drop-grid` class.

```html
<div class="uk-width-large" uk-drop>
  <div class="uk-child-width-1-2@m uk-drop-grid" uk-grid>â€¦</div>
</div>
```

Use one of the classes from the [Width component](/docs/width) to adjust the drop's width.

<Example component="drop" index={3} />

## Position

By default, the drop is positioned below the toggle. To change its position, set the `pos` option to the `uk-drop` attribute. The first part of the value refers to the side where the drop is positioned, while the second part defines its alignment to the toggle.

| Position        | Description                                                                |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `top-left`      | Positions the drop above the toggle and aligns it to the left.             |
| `top-center`    | Positions the drop above the toggle and aligns it to the center.           |
| `top-right`     | Positions the drop above the toggle and aligns it to the right.            |
| `bottom-left`   | Positions the drop below the toggle and aligns it to the left.             |
| `bottom-center` | Positions the drop below the toggle and aligns it to the center.           |
| `bottom-right`  | Positions the drop below the toggle and aligns it to the right.            |
| `left-top`      | Positions the drop to the left of the toggle and aligns it to the top.     |
| `left-center`   | Positions the drop to the left of the toggle and aligns it to the center.  |
| `left-bottom`   | Positions the drop to the left of the toggle and aligns it to the bottom.  |
| `right-top`     | Positions the drop to the right of the toggle and aligns it to the top.    |
| `right-center`  | Positions the drop to the right of the toggle and aligns it to the center. |
| `right-bottom`  | Positions the drop to the right of the toggle and aligns it to the bottom. |

```html
<div uk-drop="pos: top-left"></div>
```

<Example component="drop" index={4} />

## Boundary

By default, the drop automatically changes its positions if it exceeds the viewport or any other parent scrolling ancestor. It will flip its position to the other side to prevent it from covering the toggle and shift its alignment to fit into the viewport. To set a different boundary other than the scrolling ancestor, just add the `boundary: SELECTOR` option to the `uk-drop` attribute using a selector for the boundary. To set a boundary on one axis only, use `boundary-x: SELECTOR` or `boundary-y: SELECTOR`.

```html
<div class="my-class">
  <button type="button"></button>
  <div uk-drop="boundary: !.my-class"></div>
</div>
```

<Example component="drop" index={5} />

## Shift and flip

To disable automatic shifting and flipping, add the `shift: false` or `flip: false` option to the `uk-drop` attribute.

```html
<div uk-drop="shift: false; flip: false"></div>
```

<Example component="drop" index={6} />

## Auto update

By default, the drop repositions on scrolling. To disable dynamic positioning, add `auto-update: false` option to the `uk-drop` attribute. The drop will only be positioned once when opened.

```html
<div uk-drop="auto-update: false"></div>
```

## Target

By default, the drop is aligned to its toggle. To position the drop to a different element, just add `target: SELECTOR` option to the `uk-drop` attribute. To change just the side where the drop is positioned or the alignment to another element, use `target-x: SELECTOR` or `target-y: SELECTOR`.

```html
<div class="my-class">
  <button type="button"></button>
  <div uk-drop="target: !.my-class"></div>
</div>
```

<Example component="drop" index={7} />

## Inset

By default, the drop is positioned outside the toggle. To change the position to the inside, add the `inset: true` option to the `uk-drop` attribute. This option should only be used if the `target` option is also set so the drop doesn't cover its toggle.

```html
<div uk-drop="target: .my-class; inset: true"></div>
```

<Example component="drop" index={8} />

## Stretch

To stretch the drop to fill the size of its closest scrolling ancestor, add the `stretch: true` option to the `uk-drop` attribute. To only stretch to one axis, use `stretch: x` or `stretch: y`. If the `boundary` option is set, the drop stretches to the defined boundary.

```html
<div uk-drop="stretch: true"></div>
```

<Example component="drop" index={9} />

## Animation

Apply one or more animations to the dropdown by adding the `animation: uk-animation-*` option with one of the classes from the [Animation component](/docs/animation). You can also determine the animation's duration. Just add the `duration` option with a value in milliseconds. Set `animate-out: true` to also show an animation when closing the drop.

```html
<div uk-drop="animation: uk-animation-slide-top-small; duration: 1000"></div>
```

<Example component="drop" index={10} />

Alternatively, the Drop component has two additional animation types that are not covered by the Animation component. `slide-*` animations slide the drop and its content from a selected direction, while with the `reveal-*` animations, the content of the drop stays static and is revealed from a selected direction.

| Animation       | Description                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `slide-top`     | Slides the drop from the top.     |
| `slide-bottom`  | Slides the drop from the bottom.  |
| `slide-left`    | Slides the drop from the left.    |
| `slide-right`   | Slides the drop from the right.   |
| `reveal-top`    | Reveals the drop from the top.    |
| `reveal-bottom` | Reveals the drop from the bottom. |
| `reveal-left`   | Reveals the drop from the left.   |
| `reveal-right`  | Reveals the drop from the right.  |

```html
<div uk-drop="animation: slide-top; animate-out: true"></div>
```

<Example component="drop" index={11} />

## Offset

To define a custom offset between the drop and its toggle, add the `offset` option with a value in pixels.

```html
<div uk-drop="offset: 80"></div>
```

<Example component="drop" index={12} />

## Accessibility

The Drop component adheres to the [Menu Button WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/menubutton/) and automatically sets the appropriate WAI-ARIA roles, states and properties.

- The _toggle_ has the `button` role, the `aria-expanded` state and the `aria-haspopup` property.

### Keyboard interaction

The Drop component can be accessed through keyboard using the following keys.

- The <kbd>enter</kbd> or <kbd>space</kbd> keys open and close the drop.
- The <kbd>esc</kbd> key closes the drop even if focus has moved to another element.
