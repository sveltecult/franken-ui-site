# Animation

<p class="uk-text-lead uk-paragraph">{`A collection of smooth animations to use within your page.`}</p>

## Usage

<span class="uk-label uk-label-primary">Note</span> If you are not using Tailwind
CSS, you can skip this step. On your `tailwind.config.js` file, add the Animation
component within the `ui()` plugin.

```javascript
import ui from "franken-ui";

ui({
    components: {
        animation: {
            hooks: {}
        }
    }
}),
```

Add one of the `.uk-animation-*` classes to any element. The animation is shown when the class is added, so usually immediately on page load. To show the animation at another point, for example when the element enters the viewport, you would add the class using JavaScript â€” with the [Scrollspy component](/docs/scrollspy) for instance. This is what happens in many of UIkit's components that make use of animations. All animations themselves are implemented with CSS, so they do not require JavaScript to play.

| `.uk-animation-slide-top-small`<br/> `.uk-animation-slide-bottom-small`<br/> `.uk-animation-slide-left-small`<br/> `.uk-animation-slide-right-small`     | The element fades and slides in from the top, bottom, left or right with a smaller distance which is specified by a fixed pixel value. |

To toggle an animation on hover or focus, add the `.uk-animation-toggle` class to a parent element. Also add `tabindex="0"` to make the animation focusable through keyboard navigation and on touch devices.

```html
<div class="uk-animation-toggle" tabindex="0">
  <div class="uk-animation-fade"></div>
</div>
```

<Example component="animation" index={0} />

## Reverse modifier

By default, all animations are incoming. To reverse any animation, add the `.uk-animation-reverse` class.

```html
<div class="uk-animation-fade uk-animation-reverse"></div>
```

<Example component="animation" index={1} />

## Fast modifier

To play animations at a faster speed, add the `.uk-animation-fast` class to the element.

```html
<div class="uk-animation-fade uk-animation-fast"></div>
```

<Example component="animation" index={2} />

## Origin modifiers

By default, scaling animations originate from the center. To modify this behavior, add one of the `.uk-transform-origin-*` classes from the [Utility component](utility.md#transform-origin).

```html
<div class="uk-animation-scale-up uk-transform-origin-bottom-right"></div>
```

<Example component="animation" index={3} />

## Ken Burns

To add a simple Ken Burns effect, add the `.uk-animation-kenburns` class to any image. You can also apply the `.uk-animation-reverse` or one of the `.uk-transform-origin-*` classes from the [Utility component](utility.md#transform-origin) to modify the effect.

```html
<img class="uk-animation-kenburns" src="" width="" height="" alt="" />
```

By default, the animation starts on page load. In this example we used the [Scrollspy](/docs/scrollspy) component, to toggle the effect when the image enters the view.

<Example component="animation" index={4} />

## SVG Strokes

The Animation component can be used to animate SVG strokes. The effect looks like the SVG strokes are drawn before your eyes. The SVG image has to be injected into the markup as an inline SVG. This can be done manually or using the [SVG component](/docs/svg).

The following example shows how to add the inline SVG manually. Since you have to know the exact length of the stroke, UIkit requires you to set the length in the custom property `--uk-animation-stroke`. In this example the stroke length is `46`.

```html
<svg
  class="uk-animation-stroke"
  style="--uk-animation-stroke: 46;"
  viewBox="0 0 20 20"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
>
  <path fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="1" d="" />
</svg>
```

A much easier way is to use the [SVG component](/docs/svg) by adding `uk-svg="stroke-animation: true"` to the image element. It will calculate the stroke length and add the `--uk-animation-stroke` custom property automatically.

```html
<img src="" width="" height="" alt="" uk-svg="stroke-animation: true" />
```

<Example component="animation" index={5} />
