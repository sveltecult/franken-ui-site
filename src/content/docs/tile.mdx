# Tile

<p class="uk-text-lead uk-paragraph">{`Create layout boxes with different backgrounds that can be arranged seamlessly next to each other.`}</p>

## Usage

<span class="uk-label uk-label-primary">Note</span> If you are not using Tailwind
CSS, you can skip this step. On your `tailwind.config.js` file, add the Tile component
within the `ui()` plugin.

```javascript
import ui from "franken-ui";

ui({
    components: {
        tile: {
            hooks: {},
            media: true
        }
    }
}),
```

To apply this component, add the `.uk-tile` class to a `<div>` element. By default, a tile is blank. That is why it is important to add one of the following modifier classes for styling.

| Class                | Description                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `.uk-tile-default`   | Applies the default tile background. |
| `.uk-tile-muted`     | Applies a muted tile background.     |
| `.uk-tile-primary`   | Applies the primary tile background. |
| `.uk-tile-secondary` | Applies a secondary tile background. |

```html
<div class="uk-tile uk-tile-default"></div>
```

<Example component="tile" index={0} />

### Preserve color

The `.uk-tile-primary` and `.uk-tile-secondary` classes are extending the inverse style from the [Inverse component](/docs/inverse) automatically. If you want to prevent this behavior, for example because you are using [cards](/docs/card) in these sections, add the `.uk-preserve-color` class.

```html
<div class="uk-preserve-color uk-tile uk-tile-primary"></div>
```

<Example component="tile" index={1} />

## Tile and padding

The Tile component has some padding by default. To remove this or to apply different spacing, add one of the classes from the [Padding component](/docs/padding).

```html
<div class="uk-tile uk-padding-large uk-tile-default"></div>
```

<Example component="tile" index={2} />
