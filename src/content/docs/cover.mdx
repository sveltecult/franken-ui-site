# Cover

<p class="uk-text-lead uk-paragraph">{`Expand images, videos or iframes to cover their entire container and place your own content on top.`}</p>

## Usage

<span class="uk-label uk-label-primary">Note</span> If you are not using Tailwind
CSS, you can skip this step. On your `tailwind.config.js` file, add the Cover component
within the `ui()` plugin.

```javascript
import ui from "franken-ui";

ui({
    components: {
        cover: {
            hooks: {}
        }
    }
}),
```

To have an image cover its parent element, add the `.uk-cover-container` class to the parent and the `uk-cover` attribute to the image.

```html
<div class="uk-cover-container">
  <img src="" alt="" uk-cover />
</div>
```

<span class="uk-label uk-label-primary">Note</span> To position content on top of
the covering element, use the [Position component](/docs/position).

<Example component="cover" index={0} />

## Video

To create a video that covers its parent container, add the `uk-cover` attribute to a video. Wrap a container element around the video and add the `.uk-cover-container` class to clip the content.

The Cover component inherits all properties from the [Video component](/docs/video) which means videos are muted and play automatically. The video will pause whenever it's not visible and resume once it becomes visible again.

```html
<div class="uk-cover-container">
  <video uk-cover></video>
</div>
```

<Example component="cover" index={1} />

## Iframe

To apply the Cover component to an iframe, you need to add the `uk-cover` attribute to the iframe. Now add the `.uk-cover-container` class to a container element around the iframe to clip the content.

```html
<div class="uk-cover-container">
  <iframe src="" uk-cover></iframe>
</div>
```

<Example component="cover" index={2} />

## Responsive height

To add responsive behavior to your cover image, you need to create an invisible `<canvas>` element and assign `width` and `height` values to it, according to the aspect ratio you want the covered area to have. That way it will adapt the responsive behavior of the image.

```html
<div class="uk-cover-container">
  <canvas width="" height=""></canvas>
  <img src="" alt="" uk-cover />
</div>
```

<Example component="cover" index={3} />
