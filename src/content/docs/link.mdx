# Link

<p class="uk-text-lead uk-paragraph">{`Define different styles to integrate links into specific content.`}</p>

## Usage

<span class="uk-label uk-label-primary">Note</span> If you are not using Tailwind
CSS, you can skip this step. On your `tailwind.config.js` file, add the Link component
within the `ui()` plugin.

```javascript
import ui from "franken-ui";

ui({
    components: {
        link: {
            hooks: {}
        }
    }
}),
```

To apply this component, add the `.uk-link` class to an `<a>` element.

<Example component="link" index={0} />

## Muted modifier

If you want the link to apply a muted style instead, just add the `.uk-link-muted` class to the anchor element. You can also add the class to a parent element, and it will be applied to all `<a>` elements inside it.

```html
<a class="uk-link-muted" href="#"></a>
```

<Example component="link" index={1} />

## Text modifier

To make a link appear like body text and apply a hover effect, add the `.uk-link-text` class to the anchor element. You can also add the class to a parent element, and it will be applied to all `<a>` elements inside it. This is useful for link lists in the page footer.

```html
<a class="uk-link-text" href="#"></a>
```

<Example component="link" index={2} />

## Reset modifier

To reset a link's color, so that it inherits the color from its parent, add the `.uk-link-reset` class. There won't be any hover effect at all. This is useful for links inside heading elements. You can also add the class to a parent element, and it will be applied to all `<a>` elements inside it.

<Example component="link" index={3} />

## Toggle

To use an anchor as a parent element and apply the link style on one of its child elements, just add the `.uk-link-toggle` class to the parent element and one of the `.uk-link-*` classes to the child element. For instance, you can link the whole card and still have the hover effect on the heading.

```html
<a class="uk-link-toggle" href="#">
  <span class="uk-link-text"></span>
</a>
```

<Example component="link" index={4} />
