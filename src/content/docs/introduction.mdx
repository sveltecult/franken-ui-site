# Introduction

<p class="uk-text-lead uk-paragraph">Get familiar with Franken UI.</p>

## What is Franken UI

Franken UI is an open-source library of UI components that works as a standalone or as a Tailwind CSS plugin. It is compatible with [UIkit 3](https://getuikit.com). The design is influenced by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com).

While it may appear confusing to beginners at first glance, it is actually straightforward. Let's explore Franken UI in detail:

- **Tailwind CSS** - A utility-first CSS framework that offers classes like `flex`, `pt-4`, `text-center`, and `rotate-90`, which can be combined to create any design directly in your markup.
- **UIkit** - A modular front-end framework for developing fast and powerful web interfaces.
- **shadcn/ui** - A collection of re-usable components.

Consider this: using Tailwind CSS alone may lead to cluttered HTML with numerous utility classes, which can be a nightmare to maintain. This is where UIkit shines. It provides pre-built components such as inputs, buttons, accordions, and more, along with a mature JavaScript library for modals, popovers, carousels, toast notifications, and other features. So, what is the role of shadcn/ui? Think of it as a "skin" that has a beautiful, opinionated design.

          <p>
            While shadcn/ui offers beautifully designed components, it is
            React-first. Franken UI aims to provide a solution for those who are
            not comfortable using or do not want to use React.
          </p>
          <p class="uk-margin-small-top">
            By leveraging existing solutions like UIkit for JavaScript and
            accessibility, Franken UI avoids the need to create a new solution
            from scratch, thus sidestepping the need to deal with React or other
            ports from Vue or Svelte.
          </p>
          <p class="uk-margin-small-top">
            Simply put, shadcn/ui uses Tailwind CSS for design and Radix UI for
            behavior, while Franken UI uses Tailwind CSS for design and UIkit
            JavaScript for behavior.

      q: "Do I need to use Tailwind CSS with Franken UI?",
      a: (
        <Fragment>
          <p>
            No, Tailwind CSS is not required. However, using it can provide many
            conveniences, such as Intellisense for class names and automating
            the removal of unused CSS.
          </p>

            and reference it in your HTML. However, opting out of Tailwind CSS
            means missing out on some features and conveniences.

      a: (
        <Fragment>
          <p>
            No, not at all. In fact you can create modals, popovers, etc without
            writing a single JavaScript.

      q: "Does Franken UI support full UIkit compatibility?",

            No, the goal is to leverage UIkit JavaScript and its accessibility

      q: "Do I need to include UIkit JavaScript with Franken UI?",
      a: (
        <Fragment>
          <p>
            Including UIkit JavaScript is optional and depends on your needs for
            convenience. If you choose not to include it, you will need to
            handle toggling yourself, either through the server or another
            JavaScript alternative. Just include it.

      a: (

            Excluding UIkit icons is optional. You can use alternatives like
            Lucide, Heroicons, or icons from Flowbite.

      a: (
        <Fragment>
          <p>
            "Framework-agnostic" means that Franken UI can be used with any
            major JavaScript framework, such as Vue, React, or Svelte.

        <Fragment>
          <p>
            Franken UI is tailored for small teams and solo developers who seek
            a beautiful, reliable CSS framework without the complexity of React,
            Vue, or Svelte. It is designed with an "HTML-first" approach, making
            it accessible to developers at any skill level.

      q: "I don't like shadcn/ui. Can I remove it from Franken UI?",
      a: (
        <Fragment>
          <p>
            Yes, you can remove shadcn/ui from Franken UI by simply not setting
            components' hooks. This allows you to apply your own customizations
            as needed. By default, Franken UI uses the UIkit theme.
