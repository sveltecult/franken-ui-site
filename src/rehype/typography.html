<h1 class="uk-h1">The Joke Tax Chronicles</h1>
<p class="uk-paragraph">
  Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a very lazy king who spent all
  day lounging on his throne. One day, his advisors came to him with a problem:
  the kingdom was running out of money.
</p>
<h2 class="uk-h2 uk-margin">The King's Plan</h2>
The king thought long and hard, and finally came up with a
<a class="uk-link" href="#">brilliant plan</a>: he would tax the jokes in the
kingdom.
<blockquote class="uk-blockquote">
  "After all," he said, "everyone enjoys a good joke, so it's only fair that
  they should pay for the privilege."
</blockquote>
<h3 class="uk-h3 uk-margin">The Joke Tax</h3>
<p class="uk-paragraph">
  The king's subjects were not amused. They grumbled and complained, but the
  king was firm:
</p>
<ul class="uk-list uk-list-disc uk-margin">
  <li>1st level of puns: 5 gold coins</li>
  <li>2nd level of jokes: 10 gold coins</li>
  <li>3rd level of one-liners : 20 gold coins</li>
</ul>
<p class="uk-paragraph">
  As a result, people stopped telling jokes, and the kingdom fell into a gloom.
  But there was one person who refused to let the king's foolishness get him
  down: a court jester named Jokester.
</p>
<h3 class="uk-h3 uk-margin">Jokester's Revolt</h3>
<p class="uk-paragraph">
  Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and leaving
  jokes all over the place: under the king's pillow, in his soup, even in the
  royal toilet. The king was furious, but he couldn't seem to stop Jokester.
</p>
<p class="uk-paragraph">
  And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the jokes left by
  Jokester were so funny that they couldn't help but laugh. And once they
  started laughing, they couldn't stop.
</p>
<h3 class="uk-h3 uk-margin">The People's Rebellion</h3>
<p class="uk-paragraph">
  The people of the kingdom, feeling uplifted by the laughter, started to tell
  jokes and puns again, and soon the entire kingdom was in on the joke.
</p>
<table class="uk-margin uk-table uk-table-divider uk-table-striped">

    <tr>
      <th>King's Treasury</th>
      <th>People's happiness</th>

    <tr>

      <td>Ecstatic</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p class="uk-paragraph">
  The king, seeing how much happier his subjects were, realized the error of his
  ways and repealed the joke tax. Jokester was declared a hero, and the kingdom
  lived happily ever after.
</p>
<p class="uk-paragraph">
  The moral of the story is: never underestimate the power of a good laugh and
  always be careful of bad ideas.
